## Open Sourcing My Notes

I have been making my notes, handwritten and in physical notebooks all this while. 
Thinking about open sourcing, or more correctly, opening up all my notes publicly.

The inspiration comes from my former leader - Pankaj who takes down copious notes.
However, he is also in a crypto company right now, which is where the idea of
open sourcing the notes comes from (think decentralized, distributed)
