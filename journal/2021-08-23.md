## It's hard to fix someone else's code

One thing that I realized while trying to code up my extension yesterday [[2021-08-22]]
was that it is quite difficult to fix someone else's code. At the same time,
code that is left unmaintained for long also becomes unmanageable.

**Note to Self:** Find out a way to keep code constantly up-to-date
WRT dependencies and build, even if I am not working on it regularly.
