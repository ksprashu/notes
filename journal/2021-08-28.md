## Pasting Images in Foam

This has not been working on Windows 10 and the codebase is too old
and uses an outdated framework and library. So it is difficult to fix it
without cleaning up all the dependencies and compilation errors. 

I did test it on Mac and it seems to be working fine. Hmmmm....

It seems there is a PowerShell script that is being blocked on
Windows by the anti-virus software. I think that is a better
route to debug.

## Vaccination Done

Second shot of vaccination is completed today! Woohoo!
So maybe soon we can start socializing and getting out of the house. 
Normal life is ways away, since that can never happen until the kids
get vaccinated and resume safe normal school.

## Between Foam and Notion

I am torn between the fun of setting up something for my own use and the
time it takes (wasted) to customize (eg: #Foam) and on the other hand to
just use a ready made software / app (eg: #Notion) which does most of what 
I need to do but is not made-to-order per se.
